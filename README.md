# Web Scarping EDA

 In this project, we focus on SaaS (Software as a Service) companies operating in Egypt. Our goal is to extract data from the website "https://getlatka.com/companies/countries/egypt" to collect information about the revenue of these companies. By performing EDA on the scraped data, we aim to gain insights into the revenue distribution, market trends, and key players in the SaaS industry in Egypt.

 ## Steps:

1. Web Scraping:
   
  - We will use web scraping techniques to extract data from the specified URL, focusing on SaaS companies based in Egypt.
  - The scraping process involves navigating the website's HTML structure, identifying relevant elements such as company names and revenue figures, and extracting this information using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup.
  - We'll handle pagination if the website has multiple pages of company listings, ensuring comprehensive data collection.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

 - Once the data is scraped, we'll perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure its quality and usability for analysis.
 - This involves handling missing or erroneous values, standardizing data formats, and converting relevant information into numerical or categorical variables as needed.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

 - With the cleaned dataset, we'll conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns within the SaaS industry in Egypt.
 - We'll explore the distribution of revenue among SaaS companies, identify outliers or anomalies, and analyze trends over time if historical data is available.
 -EDA techniques such as summary statistics, histograms, box plots, and correlation analysis will help us understand the characteristics and dynamics of the SaaS market in Egypt.

## Conclusion: 

This project involved scraping data from a webpage using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests. Initially, the code fetched HTML content from a specified URL and parsed it to extract relevant information about company names and their corresponding details. It then structured this data into a DataFrame using the Pandas library. After populating the DataFrame, the code performed operations such as cleaning and organizing the data for analysis. This project demonstrates the utilization of web scraping techniques and data manipulation skills to extract and process information from web sources for further analysis or visualization.
